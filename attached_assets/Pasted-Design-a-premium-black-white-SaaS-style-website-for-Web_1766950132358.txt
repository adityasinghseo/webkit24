Design a premium black & white SaaS-style website for Webkit24, a next-gen digital marketing and AI-powered software company.

Webkit24 is NOT a typical agency.
It offers:

Digital Marketing

AI Automation

Marketing AI Tools

Website, Software & App Development

Business Growth Systems

The website must feel like:

A platform, not an agency brochure

🎨 Design Language & Visual Style
Color Theme

Primary: Deep Black + White

Accent: Soft Grey / Charcoal

Optional micro-accent: very subtle neon (blue or orange) ONLY on hover/interactions

Look & Feel

Premium

Minimal

SaaS / Product-based

Apple + Stripe + Notion inspired

Heavy use of:

White space

Grid layouts

Smooth micro-animations

Interactive sections

🚫 No stock “agency” layouts
🚫 No clutter
🚫 No marketing buzzword overload

🧠 CORE DIFFERENTIATOR (MOST IMPORTANT)

The website must ENGAGE visitors and GIVE VALUE before selling.

Instead of “About Us / Services / Contact” only, the homepage should feel like an interactive growth playground.

🚀 HOMEPAGE HERO SECTION (OUT-OF-THE-BOX)
Hero Section Goal

Immediately make visitors think:

“This company thinks differently. Let me explore.”

Hero Layout

Split hero section into 3 interactive paths:

🔹 Hero Headline

Bold, minimal, confident

Example direction (not exact text):

We don’t market brands.
We build growth systems.

Subtext:

AI, automation, marketing & software — designed for modern businesses.

🔹 Hero Interactive Blocks (VERY IMPORTANT)
